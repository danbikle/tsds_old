<html>
<pre>
The files in this folder should contain syntax I want to reuse among pages.
For example, the links at the top of the page should be reusable code.
So, the syntax for thos links should be in this folder.
Syntax for a specific page should be in another folder.

For example, the syntax for the contact page is here:
~/spy611v2/app/views/posts/contact.erb

Rails allows me to combine the reusable syntax with the specific syntax.

Look at posts.erb in this folder for an example of how to do that.

In posts.erb you will find a line which looks like this:

    <%= yield %>

The above line tells Rails where I want the specific syntax brought inside the reusable syntax.
