%h2 Class07 Lab Answer:
%h2 Install engines package with --save option

%p This was easy.

%p The syntax below added a declaration to ~/d1d2/package.json

%p The declaration is useful if I want to run this app on heroku.com

%p Also I added an entry to .gitignore which will prevent git from storing node_modules.

%p Software in node_modules should not be shared between laptops.

%p It is better I fill node_modules with npm rather than from git.

.syntax
  %pre
    %code.bash
      cd ~/d1d2
      echo node_modules >> .gitignore
      npm install engines --save
