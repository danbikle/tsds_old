%h2 Class09 Lab Answer:
%h2 Login to Droplet as root

%p I started this lab by memorizing the ip address displayed next to my new Droplet:

%p 138.68.11.196

%p Next I placed a simple entry in a file called ~/.ssh/config

%p If you don't have a .ssh/config file, you should create one now.

%p The syntax I typed into ~/.ssh/config looks like this:

.syntax
  %pre
    =render 'class09do13'

%p Next, I typed in a simple shell command:

.syntax
  %pre
    %code.bash ssh dig10

%p DigitalOcean let me in; I saw this:

.syntax
  %pre
    =render 'class09do14'

%p Notice that I shutdown the Droplet.
%p DigitalOcean charged $0.03 to my credit card.
