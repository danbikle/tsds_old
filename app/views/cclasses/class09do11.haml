%h2 Class09 Lab Answer:
%h2 Login to Droplet as root

%p I started this lab by creating an ssh-key.

%p If you already have an ssh-key, you don't need a new one.

%p I use a simple shell command to create a new key (actually it is a pair of keys).

.syntax
  %pre
    %code.bash ssh-keygen -t rsa

%p When it asks me for a passphrase, I just press the enter-key twice.

%p The last time I created an ssh-key-pair, I saw this:

.syntax
  %pre
    =render 'class09d012'

%p The file, ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub, is a file I share with the public (in this case, DigitalOcean).

%p It is like the lock on your car-door; it is exposed to the public.

%p Anyone who has the private-key can unlock it.
