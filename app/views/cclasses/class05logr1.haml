%h2 Class05 Lab Answer:
%h2 Use Logistic Regression to train and predict from allpredictions.csv

%p I wrote a simple script to do this lab:
.syntax
  %pre
    =render 'class05logr2'

%p After I ran the script, I saw this:
.syntax
  %pre
    =render 'class05logr3'

%p When I study the above predictions I observe these facts:
%ul
  %li This model has learned that pctlead 'reverts to mean'.
  %li After down-days, mean-reversion is slightly stronger than after up-days.
  %li The two most predictve features are pctlag1 and pctlag2
