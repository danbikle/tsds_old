%h2 Class02 Lab Answer:
%h2 Create EC2 instance

%p This is an easy lab.

%p I click this link:
%p
  %a(href='https://us-west-2.console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/v2/home?region=us-west-2' target='x')
    https://us-west-2.console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/v2/home?region=us-west-2
%p AWS might ask me to login.
%p I should see something like this:
%img(src='/class02/class02aws1b.png')

%p Next, I click the blue-Launch-Instance button.

%p I should see something like this:

%ul
  %li Click Community AMIs on left side.
  %li
    Search for an AMI which runs Ubuntu14 or Ubuntu16.
  %li If you find it, Click blue Select button on right side.
  %li Specify you want a t2.medium instance with 4GB of Memory.
  %li Click Next: Configure ...
  %li Click Next: Add Storage
  %li Click Next: Tag Instance

  %li
    Click Next: Configure Security ...
    %ul
      %li Click Add Rule:
      %li
        Custom TCP Rule:
        %ul
          %li HTTPS (about 1/2 way down)
    %ul
      %li
        Click Add Rule:
      %li
        Custom TCP Rule:
        %ul
          %li Put 2016 in port-range-field
          %li Set source to 'anywhere'

  %li Intent above is to open ports 443 and 2016
  %li Click Review Launch blue botton
  %li Click Launch blue botton
  %li Create (or pick existing) PEM key
  %li I should see 'Launching' message from AWS.
  %li
    While waiting for launch, copy the key to ~/.ssh/tsds.pem:
    %ul 
      %li mkdir -p ~/.ssh/
      %li cp ~/Downloads/whatever.pem ~/.ssh/tsds.pem
      %li chmod 600 ~/.ssh/tsds.pem
  %li
    After launch, note the Public IP address of the new instance:
    %ul
      %li I should see something like this:
      %li 54.201.123.142

  %li
    After launch, I create (or update) ~/.ssh/config with syntax like this:
    .syntax
      %pre
        =render 'spy611aws10'

  %li
    I should be able to login with simple shell command:
    .syntax
      %pre
        %code.bash ssh uws

  %li
    I should see something like this:
    .syntax
      %pre
        =render 'spy611aws11'

%p That completes this lab.

%p
  You should probably 'stop' (or 'terminate') the EC2 instance to prevent Amazon from
  loading your credit card with charges.  You can start it later when you need it.

%p
  The cost is low if you 'stop' the EC2 instance when you do not use it.

%p
  The difference between stop and terminate is that a stopped instance can be restarted.
  
%p
  I terminate any instance I want gone forever; terminate means permanent.
