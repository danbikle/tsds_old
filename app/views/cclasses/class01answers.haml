  %li What are Histograms?
  %ul
    %li A histogram converts one dimensional data into a two dimensional visualization which displays 'frequency'.
    %li For example I could convert a list of SAT scores into a histogram.
    %li Perhaps a next step would be to compare my SAT score to the histogram:
    %li
      %a(href='https://www.google.com/search?q=histogram+of+sat+scores&tbm=isch' target='x')
        https://www.google.com/search?q=histogram+of+sat+scores&tbm=isch
    %li After that comparison, I might understand how frequent my score is compared to other's scores.
    %li It is easy to plot a simple histogram using Python.
    %li The demo below plots a histogram of one day gains of S &amp; P 500:
    %li=render 'class01hist1'    
    %li The above script should run on your laptop if you have Anaconda Python installed.
    %li Homework: Install Anaconda Python on your laptop.

    %li The above script should give me a simple histogram:

  %li What are Scatter Plots?
  %ul
    %li
      A Scatter Plot is a two dimensional visualization of the relationship between two variables.
    %li Generally a Scatter Plot has an X-Axis and Y-Axis.
    %li My hope is that Y depends on X.
    %li I often use a scatter plot to place day1-gain on X-Axis and day2-gain on Y-Axis.
    %li If day2-gain depends on day1-gain, I might be able to see it in the scatter plot.
    %li Here is some syntax to create a scatter plot:
    %li=render 'class01sp2016'
    %li The above script has a bug. Do you see it?
    %li The above script should give me a plot like this:
    %li
      %img(src='/class01/spy2016.png')
    %li
      %hr/

  %li What is Correlation?
  %ul
    %li Correlation measures how much Y depends on X.
    %li If day2-gain depends on day1-gain, correlation measures the strength of the dependency.
    %li If day2-gain is independent of day1-gain, correlation is zero.
    %li If day2-gain usually increases after a day1-gain increase, correlation should be near +1.
    %li If day2-gain usually decreases after a day1-gain increase, correlation should be near -1.
    %li If abs(correlation) > 0.5, I should be able to 'see it' when I put the data in a scatter plot.
    %li Here is some syntax to calculate correlation.
    %li=render 'class01corr'

  %li What is a Time Series Plot?
  %ul
    %li A Time Series Plot uses the X-axis to plot either a time stamp or a date.
    %li Then I use the Y-axis to plot a value like price:
    %li=render 'class01ts1'
    %li
      %img(src='/class01/ts1.png')
    %li
      %hr/

  %li What are Time Series Calculations?
  %ul
    %li I use Time Series Calculations to extract information from a Time Series.
    %li Take IBM for example. A simple calculation is 'lag1' which is price difference between days.
    %li An enhancement to lag1 is pctlag1 which is percentage price difference between days.
    %li Here is a demo of a pctlag1 calculation:
    %li=render 'class01lag1'
    %li
      %hr/
