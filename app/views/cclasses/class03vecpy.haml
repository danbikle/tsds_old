%p To implement a Vector in Python I should use a NumPy array rather than a Python list.
%p Here is a simple demo which creates two NumPy arrays and then adds them together.

.syntax
  %pre
    %code
      import numpy as np
      vector1 = np.array([1.1, 2.2])
      vector2 = np.array([3.3, 4.4])
      vector3 = vector1 + vector2
      print(vector3)
