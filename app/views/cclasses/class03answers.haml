  %li What is a Vector?
  %ul
    %li I start my definition of a vector to be a collection of numbers.
    %li Next I say that vectors can be added if they match size.
    %li For example I could define two vectors and add them:
    %li vector1 = [1.1,2.2,3.3]
    %li vector2 = [4.1,5.2,6.3]
    %li vector1 + vector2 is [5.2, 7.4, 9.6]
    %li I could then expand the definition to say that I can operate on vectors with arithmetic.
    %li For example the expression below would be valid:
    %li vector4 = 2 * vector1 + vector2 / vector1
    %li vector4 is [2.2,4.4,6.6] + [4.1/1.1, 5.2/2.2, 6.3/3.3]
    %li vector4 is [2.2+4.1/1.1, 4.4+5.2/2.2, 6.6+6.3/3.3]
    %li If I want to extend the definition further, I would take a class in Linear Algebra:

    In Python how to implement a Vector?
    %ul
      %li In Python I use a Numpy array to implement vector:
      %li
        %pre
          %code
            import numpy as np
            vector1 = np.array([1.1,2.2,3.3])
            vector2 = np.array([4.1,5.2,6.3])
            vector4 = 2 * vector1 + vector2 / vector1
            print(vector4)

  %li
    Can a Vector contain a mix of numbers and strings?
    %ul
      %li Using my above definition, no. 
      %li I can do arithmetic on numbers but not strings.

    What is a Scalar?
    %ul
      %li A Scalar is just a number.
      %li I can use a scalar to 'scale' a vector:
      %li
        %pre
          %code
            import numpy as np
	    myscalar = 2.0
            vector1  = np.array([1.1,2.2,3.3])
            vector2  = np.array([4.1,5.2,6.3])
            vector4  = myscalar * vector1 + vector2 / vector1
            print(vector4)

    What is a Tensor?
    %ul
      %li Both a vector and a scalar are a type of tensor.
      %li A tensor is a more general type of object.
      %li A common type of tensor is a collection of vectors.
      %li One abstract concept about a tensor is that I can constrain the operations I can apply to the tensor.
      %li This abstraction allows me to model physical properties of objects using tensors.

    What is NumPy?
    %ul
      %li NumPy is a Python module.
      %li I can use NumPy to do some types of linear algebra calculations.
      %li I should know NumPy if I want to use popular Python machine learning modules.
