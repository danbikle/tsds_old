%h2 Class02 Lab Answer:
%h2 Learn about Virtualbox network settings

%p To start this lab, I should start the virtualbox-GUI and then click on settings for one of the instances:

%img(src='/class02/class02vbox12a.png')

%p I notice that this instance allows me to configure four adapters.

%p A little bit of networking knowledge here can go a long way.

%p
  With a real laptop I can actually see one of the adapters.
  It is a port on the side which accepts an ethernet cable.
  Another adapter I know about, but cannot see, is the WIFI adapter.

%p
  I usually ignore the ethernet adapter and configure only the WIFI adapter.

%p
  Often I configure the WIFI adapter so it gets an IP address from a DHCP server inside a local WIFI router.

%p
  So, to connect my laptop to WIFI is usually easy.

%p
  I can use this same thinking process when I configure adapters of a virtualbox instance.

%p
  A good place to start is to disable Adapter 2, 3, 4.
  
%p
  Then I enable Adapter 1 so it looks something like this:
%img(src='/class02/class02vbox12a.png')

%p
  I need to be aware that each adapter has not one, but two configurations.

%p
  The first configuration is done by the virtualbox-GUI.
  
%p
  When the instance boots up and sees the above configuration, it thinks that I have plugged
  an ethernet cable into Adapter 1.

%p
  The second configuration is done by a GUI inside of Linux after it has booted:
%img(src='/class02/class02vbox12b.png')

%p
  One mistake I have made in the past is to configure Adapter 1 in virtualbox-GUI and then
  configure the wrong adapter in the Linux GUI.
  I avoid this mistake in the above images be noting that the MAC Address 080027B63DB6 matches the
  Hardware Address in the Linux GUI: 08:00:27:B6:3D:B6

%p
  Usually at that point I am done with network configuration for that instance.

%p
  Sometimes I might want to configure Adpater 2 of the instance so it will support
  ssh traffic from users who want to login to the virtualbox instance.

%p
  To set this up, I need to understand that the virtualbox instance (the 'guest')
  depends on the physical adapter of my laptop (the 'host').

%p I use a shell command on the host to give me inormation about the physical adapter:

.syntax
  %pre
    =render 'class02vbox12c'

%p The ifconfig command tells me the physical adapter is called: 'enp59s0'.

%p With that small piece of information, I can now configure Adpater 2 of the 'guest'.

%p I display some images below which contain clues on how to do this:
%img(src='/class02/class02vbox12d.png')
%br/
%img(src='/class02/class02vbox12e.png')
%br/
%img(src='/class02/class02vbox12f.png')

%p
  In the above example, the 'guest' is configured to listen for traffic at 192.168.1.101
  if that traffic comes from adapter: enp59s0 on the 'host'.

%p
  Note that the MAC Address 080027248D74 in the virtualbox-GUI,
  mathches the Device MAC Address 08:00:27:24:8D:74 in the Linux-guest-GUI.

%p The above discussion is a good example of a virtualbox bridged adapter configuration.

%p
  It is called a bridged configuration because I see it as creating a bridge
  between a guest-adapter and a host-adapter.

%p It is easy to find discussion about this topic via google:
