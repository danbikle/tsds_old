%h2
  In cnj16.html, build an array from:
  %br/
  http://www.spy611.com/csv/allpredictions.csv

%p This required some knowledge about JavaScript.

%p The JavaScript in my browser has a security feature which prevents me reading most files on my latptop.

%p A security hole I can exploit is to read JavaScript files on my laptop using the script-element.

%p So, I used curl to copy allpredictions.csv to my laptop.

%p Then, I used sed to transform allpredictions.csv into allpredictions.js

%p Next, I used a script-element to read allpredictions.js which serves the data as a giant string.

%p Then, I used D3.js to transform the string into an array.

%p Finally, I used the browser debugger to see the array.

%p The curl and sed commands are listed below:

.syntax
  %pre
    =render 'class06cnj16g'

%p The syntax in cnj16.html is listed below:

.syntax
  %pre
    =render 'class06cnj16h'
