%h2 Class08 Lab Answer:
%h2 For 2016, report on aggregated Accuracy

%p When I aggregate Accuracy, I want to aggregate the Accuracy of Long-Only predictions along with the Logistic-Regression predictions.

%p The classic way to aggregate is to compute True-Predictions / All-Predictions.

%p After I aggregate I want to answer an obvious question:

%p Is Logistic-Regression better than Long-Only?
